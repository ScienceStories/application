After 40 years of service to the National Museum of Natural History, Lutterlough retired in 1983. For 14 years Lutterlough ran the elevators, but moved on to a second career after asking Dr. J. F. Gates Clarke if there were any openings in his department. Clarke hired Lutterlough as an inspect preparator. During the next 26 years in the department, she took college level courses to increase her knowledge of entomology and learned German to help with her work."},{"label":"Contained within","value":"Smithsonian Institution Archives, Record Unit 371, Box 4, Folder July 1983"},{"label":"Contact information","value":"Institutional History Division, Smithsonian Archives, 600 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20024-2520, SIHistory@si.edu"},{"label":"Unique Asset Name","value":"SIA-SIA2009-3239-000001"},{"label":"Standard number","value":"SIA2009-3239"},{"label":"Date","value":"July 1983"},{"label":"Type","value":"Photographic print"},{"label":"Type","value":"Person, candid"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Elevator operators"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Women"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Smithsonian Institution--Employees"},{"label":"Topic","value":"African Americans"},{"label":"Restrictions & Rights","value":"No restrictions"},{"label":"Link","value":"<a href='https://collections.si.edu/search/record/edanmdm:siris_sic_12130'>View Object</a>"}],"license":"https://www.si.edu/termsofuse","attribution":"Smithsonian Institution","sequences":[{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/manifest/SIA-SIA2009-3239-000001","@type":"sc:Sequence","canvases":[{"@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/canvas-SIA-SIA2009-3239-000001","@type":"sc:Canvas","label":"image SIA-SIA2009-3239-000001","height":3000,"width":2373,"images":[{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/SIA-SIA2009-3239-000001","@type":"oa:Annotation","motivation":"sc:painting","resource":{"@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/SIA-SIA2009-3239-000001/full/full/0/default.jpg","@type":"dctypes:Image","height":3000,"width":2373,"format":"image/jpeg","service":{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/SIA-SIA2009-3239-000001","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}},"on":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/SIA-SIA2009-3239-000001"}]}]}]}
