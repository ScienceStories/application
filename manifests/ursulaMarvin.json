Dr. Marvin is part of the 1978-1979 United States Antarctic Research Program sponsored by the National Science Foundation, and will search for meteorites from the base at McMurdo Station, the American Antarctic research center located on the southern tip of Ross Island on the shore of McMurdo Sound. The nine week expedition from December 1978 to January 1979 will include Japanese and American scientists. Until 1970, only 2,000 different meteorites had ever been identified, but that year a Japanese expedition located a large concentration of meteorites on the White Continent. Since then more than a thousand new specimens have been added to world collections."},{"label":"Contained within","value":"Smithsonian Institution Archives, Record Unit 371, Box 2, Folder: December 1978"},{"label":"Contact information","value":"Institutional History Division, Smithsonian Institution Archives, 600 Maryland Avenue, S.W., Washington, D.C. 20024-2520, SIHistory@si.edu"},{"label":"Place","value":"Antarctica"},{"label":"Place","value":"Polar regions"},{"label":"Unique Asset Name","value":"SIA-96-1022"},{"label":"Standard number","value":"96-1022"},{"label":"Date","value":"December 1978"},{"label":"Type","value":"Photographic print"},{"label":"Type","value":"Person, candid"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Women"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Geology"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Astrophysics"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Meteorites"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Meteoritics"},{"label":"Topic","value":"Discovery and exploration"},{"label":"Restrictions & Rights","value":"No restrictions"},{"label":"Link","value":"<a href='https://collections.si.edu/search/record/edanmdm:siris_sic_8355'>View Object</a>"}],"license":"https://www.si.edu/termsofuse","attribution":"Smithsonian Institution","sequences":[{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/manifest/SIA-96-1022","@type":"sc:Sequence","canvases":[{"@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/canvas-SIA-96-1022","@type":"sc:Canvas","label":"image SIA-96-1022","height":3000,"width":1819,"images":[{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2/context.json","@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/SIA-96-1022","@type":"oa:Annotation","motivation":"sc:painting","resource":{"@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/SIA-96-1022/full/full/0/default.jpg","@type":"dctypes:Image","height":3000,"width":1819,"format":"image/jpeg","service":{"@context":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/context.json","@id":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/SIA-96-1022","profile":"http://iiif.io/api/image/2/level2.json"}},"on":"https://ids.si.edu/ids/iiif/SIA-96-1022"}]}]}]}
